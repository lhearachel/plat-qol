# repoints intends to rewrite data pointers to data that you define in assembly or c
#
#   0012 SkillMenuPaletteNo 0226E938
#
# this opens up overlay 12, jumps to the offset that would be in memory at 0226E938, and writes a pointer to
# SkillMenuPaletteNo there. repoints specifically also supports repointing to the data table + an offset,
# specified as so:
#
#   arm9 MainTableCombo 080517C8
#   arm9 MainTableCombo+2 080517E4
#
# the code uses MainTableCombo+2 as a direct pointer at 0x517E4 of the arm9, so we specify that it can repoint
# to that instead of the base table offset

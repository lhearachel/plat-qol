# bytereplacement specifies the overlay, offset, and bytes you want to write there:
#
#   0012 0801F738 60 B4 C0 46
#
# opens up overlay 12, jumps to the file offset 0x1F738, and writes 60 B4 C0 46 there
#
#   arm9 020CA054 60 00 2D E9
#
# opens up the arm9, jumps to the offset that would be in memory at 020CA054, and writes 60 00 2D E9 there

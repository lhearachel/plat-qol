# Entries in this file will overwrite existing bytes within a file explicitly. For example:
#
#   0012 0801F738 60 B4 C0 46
#
# This will open up overlay 12, jump to the file offset 0x01F738, and overwrite a string of
# of 4 bytes with 60 B4 C0 46.
#
#   arm9 020CA054 60 00 2D E9
#
# This will open up the arm9 binary, jump to the offset that would be in memory at 0x020CA054,
# and overwrite a string of 4 bytes with 60 00 C0 46.

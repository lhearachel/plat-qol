# Entries in this file will create jumps from existing game code to your new code, overwriting
# around 8-10 bytes of code to do so. For example:
#
#   arm9 Summary_IVEV 0808CA20 1
#
# This will open up the arm9 binary, jump to file offset 0x08CA20, and assemble the following
# at that offset:
#
#   ldr     r1, =Summary_IVEV|1
#   bx      r1
#   .pool
#
# Or, to open an overlay and perform similar:
#
#   0002 AddWildPartyPokemon_hook 080029E0 5
#
# You can link directly to C code if there is a free register to do so. The ARM Assembly standard
# specifies that r0-r3 are arguments to a function and thus are not preserved across function
# calls. Thus, if your function has fewer than 4 arguments, you can use r3 as a hook register and
# replace the entire thing.
#
# Otherwise, you'll need to link to a "hook" to the C code, where you will write some custom ASM
# code to make the game feel okay about what it's doing.
